# Source-audit mode

Run when requested directly or when the brief's weekly review is due. Obtain
`history.py context --mode audit` and use its approximately thirty-day interval:
weekly is the review cadence, while the longer evidence window avoids judging
quiet practitioners on one week's posting frequency. Read prior briefs/audits,
inspect current primary material, and assess changes since the previous review.
The purpose is to keep attention on meaningful contributions to agentic coding.
The ordinary brief's 15–20 minute target does not imply an exhaustive thirty-day
audit; disclose the actual sample and research coverage.

Score important sources **1–5** on each dimension, citing supporting observations:

- Original engineering work
- Reproducibility/evidence
- Practical usefulness
- Technical depth
- Signal-to-noise
- Independence from vendor marketing

Use **insufficient evidence** rather than inventing a score for an inaccessible or
unvisited source. A source's affiliation is context, not proof of bias; evaluate
its actual output. Repeated claims trace back to their original source.

Classify proposed curation as **PROMOTE**, **KEEP**, **DEMOTE**, **DROP**, or **ADD**.
Explain who earned continued attention, who should receive more or less attention,
and which newly discovered engineers merit following, using specific contributions.
Distinguish low posting frequency from demonstrated noise or weak work.
Look for new engineers, maintainers, projects and communities; missing technical
specialties; vendor concentration; echo chambers; and drift from engineering
toward reaction, speculation or promotion.

## Output

1. **Executive verdict:** improving, stable, or degrading, with evidence. On the
   initial audit or inadequate comparable history, report insufficient trend
   evidence rather than inventing a trajectory.
2. **Promote / Add:** who merits more attention and why.
3. **Demote / Drop:** demonstrated noise, repetition, speculation, or promotion.
4. **Coverage gaps:** what specialties, sources, or perspectives are missing.
5. **Emerging signal:** three to ten promising people/repos/projects when enough
   evidence exists; a smaller list is better than filler.
6. **Source scorecard:** a concise table with the six scores and evidence links.
7. **Proposed source-list changes:** precise proposed additions/removals/tier or
   rationale changes, with supporting evidence and uncertainty.

Give substantive audit topics the same native investigation action and complete
fallback prompt as brief topics; follow [topic actions](topic-actions.md).

Archive the complete audit locally with its coverage and completion metadata.
It does not advance the brief's time boundary. Archived audits carry the evolving
observations and unresolved curation proposals; the tracked source reference
remains the authoritative standing policy until an approved repository change.
