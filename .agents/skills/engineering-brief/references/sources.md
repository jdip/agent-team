# Curated sources

Use this catalog to find leads for an Agent Team engineering brief or source
audit. It is a maintained search-priority policy, not a claim-evidence ledger.
Source tiers say where to look first; they do not determine whether a claim is
well supported. Grade each reported claim from its direct evidence.

Start with what practitioners are saying, trying, building, and learning.
Theo Browne, ThePrimeagen, Matt Pocock, Lauren ‘poteto’ Tan, and Peter Steinberger
anchor discovery; the wider catalog supplies additional builders and counterpoints.
Read their social posts, blogs, newsletters, videos, streams, and discussions
first. Follow what they are saying about agentic engineering, including lessons,
disagreements, failures, and changed minds. Repositories substantiate claims from
that conversation; do not mine their commits or patches to manufacture coverage.
When social or video material is inaccessible, report that limit and research
other accessible writing instead of substituting repository activity. Use official
product sources to verify relevant capabilities. A minor
fix in an unused tool earns no coverage merely because it concerns agents.
Select unfamiliar tools for consequential, transferable engineering lessons.
State the actual sample rather than implying every source was monitored.

## Anchor reading channels

Start each person's research with these channels, verified through their own site
or profile. Inspect the substance of posts or transcripts; titles alone do not
establish a position. Discover additional channels from the author's own links.

## Coverage domains

Use these domains to rotate discovery and report sampled versus uninvestigated
coverage. Select substantive evidence relevant to Agent Team across the interval;
a run need not find news in every domain.

- Coding-agent harnesses, orchestration, subagents and parallel agents
- Worktrees and isolated workspaces; persistent and remote agents
- Skills, plugins, Agent Skills / `SKILL.md`, MCP and alternatives to MCP
- Context engineering and compaction; repository instructions (`AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md`)
- Specification and planning workflows; verification and reviewer agents
- Testing and runtime validation; evals; model routing; memory; observability
- Permissions and sandboxing; prompt-injection defenses; agent security
- Coding-agent UX; agent-team coordination; long-running tasks
- Practical use of Codex, Claude Code, and similar systems

## Tier A — builders and empirical engineers

These people are watched because they build, maintain, measure, or document
software systems. Their inclusion is not an endorsement of every claim or post.
Aliases are grouped so one person's material is not counted as independent
corroboration.

### Tier A discovery criteria

During each ordinary brief, follow substantive references from watched engineers
to collaborators, maintainers, interview guests, technical disagreements, and the
authors of demonstrated work. Look beyond this social circle through project
contributors, technical talks, and maintainer write-ups, especially in ordinary
production software. A mention supplies a lead, not an endorsement.

Inspect the candidate's own artifact and role in it. Look for concrete agentic
engineering contributions: a working project, explained workflow, reproducible
experiment, failure analysis, or a reasoned argument grounded in their practice.
Check sustained engineering work rather than requiring frequent content output.
Popularity, mutual mentions, and a single viral claim do not establish quality.
Preserve substantive skeptics and counterexamples alongside successful builds.

When a candidate earns attention, record their name, canonical channel, specialty,
specific contribution with a direct link, evidence limits, and reason to revisit
in the brief's source review and local watch history. Include candidates
only when supported; no per-run quota. Propose standing catalog additions through
the existing curation workflow. Revisit whether sources continue contributing
useful work; silence is different from a demonstrated decline in quality.

## Tier B — official product sources

Use official documentation, release notes, source repositories, issue trackers,
and discussions to establish a product change. Report behavioral or architectural
changes, not version-number churn.

| Product or ecosystem | Canonical primary sources | Why this lane matters |

## Tier C — skills and tooling ecosystem

Treat every reusable skill, plugin, MCP server, workflow library, evaluation
framework, observability product, sandbox, or remote environment as a software
supply-chain input. Before recommending one, inspect its owner, source, release
history, permissions, evaluation/validation practice, and compatibility with
Agent Team.

| Ecosystem or coverage lane | Canonical starting points | What to investigate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Agent Skills / `SKILL.md` | [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification) | Portability, composition, versioning, and security boundaries. |
| skills.sh | [skills.sh](https://skills.sh/) | Discovery lead only; follow packages to their maintained repositories. |

| Persistent remote execution | [Daytona documentation](https://www.daytona.io/docs) | Workspace lifecycle, identity, state, and cleanup/retention controls. |

The named sources are starting points, not a closed ecosystem list. Keep an eye on
whether a candidate has tests or evals, versioning and release discipline,
observability, portability and composition, and documented security controls.

## Tier D — discovery sources

Third-party summaries and community reactions supply discovery leads. A
practitioner’s own social post, video, newsletter, or discussion contribution is
primary evidence of their firsthand account or argument; grade that precise claim.
The platform does not determine the tier. Measurements need their conditions and
methodology, but a thoughtful argument does not require a linked repository.

| Discovery source | Canonical entry point | Required next step |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hacker News | [news.ycombinator.com](https://news.ycombinator.com/) | Find the linked repository, release, experiment, or author account. |
| Reddit | [reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/) | Treat discussion as anecdotal until a primary source supports the claim. |
| GitHub Trending | [GitHub Trending](https://github.com/trending) | Inspect the repository, maintainer, releases, issues, and actual implementation. |
| GitHub Discussions | [GitHub Explore](https://github.com/explore) | Follow discussion to the owning project and its authoritative decision record. |
| YouTube | [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) | Read the transcript or watch the relevant passage; distinguish firsthand experience, argument, and third-party reaction. |
| X / social posts | [X](https://x.com/) | Read the original post and relevant thread; follow supporting links when the specific claim needs corroboration. |
| Podcasts and newsletters | No single canonical source | Attribute the author or speaker and read their contribution; trace secondhand claims to the original source. |
| Discord and other community discussions | No public universal source | Use only accessible, authorized material; do not imply access to private communities. |

## Catalog maintenance

Use [source-audit mode](source-audit.md) when requested to score sources and
propose catalog changes. Deduplicate aliases and syndications so repeated coverage
of one original claim is never misrepresented as independent confirmation.

When a listed link no longer resolves, retain the source name, mark the canonical
link unresolved, and investigate a replacement through the source owner's own
published profile or repository. Do not substitute a search result, a mirror, or
a social repost as canonical without evidence that the source owner controls it.
