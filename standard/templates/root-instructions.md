# Root AGENTS.md outline

Adapt this outline to the actual repository. Replace descriptive placeholders;
do not publish a placeholder declaration or duplicate machine-level settings.

```markdown
# <Repository name>

<Repository-specific purpose, scope, and invariants.>

- For issue tracking and handoffs, use docs/agents/issue-tracker.md.
- For domain terminology and decisions, use docs/agents/domain.md.
- For implementation and verification, use docs/development.md for the actual
  environment, Application Code/Tooling classification, and checks.

## Visibility and publication

<Record verified current public/private visibility, separately from future intent.
For public targets, link the repository-owned public-work policy and approved
license. Private preparation may use an explicitly approved public-work policy.
Resolve unknown or conflicting state; replace this placeholder with actual guidance.>

Follow the applicable repository publication policy before GitHub writes,
including source, metadata and evidence. Changes to visibility or licensing require
the owner's explicit authorization.

## Languages and environments

<Declare the approved language, runtime, build/package toolchain, and
execution/deployment environment for each existing component, such as CLI, app,
server, or Tooling. Omit absent components
and replace this placeholder with actual choices or a direct authoritative link.>

Use each component's approved environment. Adding a language, runtime, build/
package toolchain, or execution/deployment environment requires explicit user
authorization, including for helpers and tooling; a feature request does not
imply it. Prefer the same existing language
across components where practical. Preserve established code; this preference does
not authorize a migration or rewrite.

## Checkouts and delivery

Keep the primary local checkout on `test`, refreshed from `origin/test` by
fast-forward only when clean. Reserve `test` for that checkout; never check it out
in a linked worktree. Make all changes on `codex/` feature branches in separate
worktrees based on fresh `origin/test`. Preserve local work and attached checkouts
before switching or updating. Detached revision worktrees are valid for verification.

Use the global `pr-to-test` skill with `docs/workflows/pr-to-test.md` and invoke
`scripts/pr-to-test.sh` through checks, merge, and verified test delivery, including
for documentation and small fixes. Do not commit or push changes directly to
`test` or bypass branch protections.

Promote only on a separate explicit user request. Use the global `promote-to-main`
skill with `docs/workflows/promote-to-main.md` and invoke
`scripts/promote-to-main.sh` from the clean primary `test` checkout through
verification and main-to-test synchronization. If either canonical script is
missing, check for duplicates, file an implementation issue in this repository,
and report the delivery blocker instead of inventing an alternate flow.

## Repository Standard

- Source: https://github.com/jdip/agent-team
- Revision: <full adopted commit SHA>
```

Retain only guidance justified by current needs after the selected standard's
guidance-retirement assessment. Use the actual selected source revision and ship
its declaration with the adoption/upgrade implementation. The source repository's
scripts and runbooks are a small working example for its Tooling; adapt actual
application gates and deployment effects locally rather than importing assumptions.
