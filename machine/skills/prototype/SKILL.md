description: Build a throwaway prototype to answer a design question. Use when the user wants to sanity-check whether a state model or logic feels right, or explore what a UI should look like.

# Prototype

A prototype is **throwaway code that answers a question**. The question decides the shape.

## Pick a branch

Identify which question is being answered, using the user's prompt, the surrounding code, or by asking if the user is around:

- **"Does this logic / state model feel right?"** → [LOGIC.md](LOGIC.md). Build a single shareable HTML file (free-play buttons plus tabbed guided walkthroughs) that pushes the state machine through cases that are hard to reason about on paper, and that a non-developer can drive.
- **"What should this look like?"** → [UI.md](UI.md). Generate several radically different UI variations on a single route, switchable via a URL search param and a floating bottom bar.

The two branches produce very different artifacts, so getting this wrong wastes the whole prototype. If the question is genuinely ambiguous and the user isn't reachable, default to whichever branch better matches the surrounding code (a backend module → logic; a page or component → UI) and state the assumption at the top of the prototype.

## Rules that apply to both

1. **Throwaway from day one, and clearly marked as such.** Put the artifact in an authorized, task-owned location close to the module or page it explores when that context is useful. Name it so a casual reader can see it is a prototype. For throwaway UI routes, follow the project's routing convention.
2. **Use the existing environment.** Make the prototype trivial to run through an already supported project command, or open a self-contained artifact directly when that format needs no new project runtime or toolchain. Keep its format consistent with the project's approved languages and environment.
3. **No persistence by default.** State lives in memory. Persistence is the thing the prototype is _checking_, not something it should depend on. If the question explicitly involves a database, hit a scratch DB or a local file with a clear "PROTOTYPE, wipe me" name.
4. **Verify the question.** Run the prototype through the relevant scenarios and inspect rendered behavior. Honor required local gates; avoid adding production polish or a new test suite merely for a throwaway artifact.
5. **Surface the state.** After every action (logic) or on every variant switch (UI), print or render the full relevant state so the user can see what changed.
6. **End with a verdict and handoff.** Capture the question, the evidence from the
   prototype, and the resulting decision in the artifact or in the authorized
   planning record. For a planning-only request, end with the concrete implementation handoff.
   When the existing request already authorizes implementation, continue with the
   selected decision through the repository's normal workflow without asking
   again. A verdict alone does not authorize changes to production code.
