Publish one approved implementation specification parent and its outcome-based
native child issues. Parent membership and blocking are separate GitHub
relationships. This skill prepares work only; it neither selects an active
backlog nor authorizes implementation.

## Confirm the approved handoff

Resolve the current repository with `gh repo view`, then read its tracker
instructions, the approved specification, its comments, and linked design and
decision sources. When the source is a Wayfinder effort, confirm that the entire
map is resolved before publishing. Use issue bodies for the current approved scope
and acceptance criteria; comments supply decision history and evidence. Update a
body to incorporate an approved amendment before it becomes the published
contract.

Before creating anything, search open `implementation:backlog` parents and their
native children for the same linked sources and scope. Reuse that same-effort
parent and approved children when found. Inspect each proposed existing child's
parent, dependencies, state, and assignees; preserve claims and work attached to
another effort. Never create a duplicate parent or ticket merely because a prior
publication was partial.

If the specification and ticket breakdown were not reviewed together, draft both
and present one ordinary-text batch: parent scope and acceptance criteria; every
ticket's independently verifiable outcome and acceptance criteria; and each real
blocking edge. Wait for the user's approval. Reuse an earlier explicit approval
only when it covers the same parent scope and breakdown. Do not create issues as
an administrative substitute for missing approval.

## Publish the approved batch

Create or update the one specification parent with its current approved body and
the `implementation:backlog` label. Include links to the resolved map and
material decisions, but do not duplicate their history. Do not replace a parent
from another effort, alter claims or dependencies, or change the saved
active-backlog pointer. Preserve an existing parent's actual scheduling state.

Create the approved child issues in dependency order. Each body contains:

- the parent reference;
- the independently verifiable outcome;
- current acceptance criteria; and
- specification and relevant decision links.

Set acceptance evidence by purpose: Application Code requires linting, type
checking, validation, meaningful behavioral tests, and strong coverage; Tooling
requires successful real use and focused source checks. Prefer clean replacements
that remove superseded callers and configuration. Use expand--contract only when a
concrete blast radius requires temporary coexistence.

Create children without assignees. A ticket being prepared is not execution
authorization; an explicitly authorized `$next-issue` or `$next-issue-loop`
selects and claims work later.

For GitHub, use native sub-issues for membership. Before attaching an existing
issue, inspect `GET repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<child>/parent`. Attach a detached
approved child with `POST repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<parent>/sub_issues` and
`-F sub_issue_id=<child-database-id>`. A child already attached to the intended
parent needs no change. A child attached to another parent, or carrying an
existing claim, stays in place unless the user explicitly authorizes that move.

After membership is established, add each genuine blocker independently with
`POST repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<child>/dependencies/blocked_by` and
`-F issue_id=<blocker-database-id>`. Do not encode dependency state as a task-list
order or substitute parent membership for a blocker edge.

Use the tracker fallback only when the native membership or dependency feature is
proven unavailable: follow the repository convention for an ordered `## Backlog`
list and `Part of #<parent>` children, and record blockers in the designated child
body. Authentication, authorization, network, or service failures are not feature
unavailability; preserve the partial state and report the access failure.

## Read back and recover

Read `GET repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<parent>/sub_issues --paginate` and each
child's `GET repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<child>/dependencies/blocked_by --paginate`.
Confirm that all approved children have the intended parent and the actual blockers
match the approved breakdown.

Confirm each parent and child links to the relevant design sources, then read the
design body and comments for a reciprocal link to the parent. If it is missing,
add one concise source comment and read it back. Retain the design's existing
decision history rather than replacing it.

If a write partially fails, inspect the parent, each affected child's parent,
dependencies, state, and claims before retrying. Retry only the missing attachment
or edge after readback. Preserve completed writes and never create a replacement
parent, duplicate ticket, steal a claim, or reparent another effort to recover.

Report the parent and child URLs, verified membership and dependencies, and the
source links. Publication alone leaves a newly created parent prepared; an
existing parent's active or executing state is preserved. An explicitly authorized
backlog selection and `$next-issue` or `$next-issue-loop` request controls future
execution.
