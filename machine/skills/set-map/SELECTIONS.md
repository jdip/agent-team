# Selection scope and handoff

Read this contract when a workflow selects, reads, resumes, forks, moves or hands
off a saved map or implementation backlog. The set-map package owns the shared
resolver; set-backlog uses that installed sibling. Use their scripts, never direct
state-file edits. Run `--help` for exact arguments. The existing Python 3.11+
runtime is selected with `AGENT_TEAM_PYTHON` when needed.

## Establish the binding

An **effort scope** is a stable identifier for independently selected work in one
repository. It is not a branch, checkout path, issue number or permission to act.
A **task owner** is the verified host task/session identity, or an explicit unique
identity recorded with this task when the host provides none. Use path-safe
identifiers accepted by the helper. Establish both from the current task's explicit
context; missing or conflicting context is an error. Do not discover ownership
by enumerating scope files or inheriting a shell environment from another task.
For a new effort, the agent may choose a unique scope and report it under existing
selection authority. Reuse the established scope on continuation.

Each scope has independent map and backlog records, each with its own owner and
generation. Two tasks in one checkout use different scopes, just as tasks in
separate worktrees do. Following a partial handoff, a task may bind its map and
backlog to different scopes; record each explicitly. One scope does not silently
replace a task's other selection. State lives untracked under
`codex-selection-scopes` in Git's absolute common directory. A scope record is
atomically replaced under a scope lock; the two entries change together only for
an explicitly requested full handoff. Legacy root pointers remain separate.

Use the relevant selector's `show --scope <scope> --owner <task>` only when first
binding to an explicitly selected effort or receiving an approved handoff. Retain
the returned scope, owner, generation and issue URL in the current task/handoff
context. For an existing binding use `check --scope <scope> --owner <task>
--generation <generation>`; never replace a stale generation with `show` to make
a continuation succeed. A confirmed absent entry is different from unreadable,
invalid, inaccessible, foreign or transferred state. Only explicit absence in a
known scope permits initial `select --expect-absent`.

Before repository/tracker mutations, on resume after interruption or human input,
and between loop tickets, check the retained binding and current tracker/design
state. Failure stops dependent work with existing state preserved. Changes made
through an authorized selection operation return a new binding; record it as that
operation's result. A selection error never authorizes a new scope, another issue,
a takeover or removal of an uncertain lock.

## Select and continue

`select` validates an open issue in the current repository with the required
`wayfinder:map` or `implementation:backlog` role. An initial selection requires
`--expect-absent`; changing one requires the current owner and `--generation`.
Read the returned issue name/URL, scope, owner and generation back. Preserve the
other selection. All consumers use this contract, including triage and planning
or specification handoffs. A closed selected issue remains historical state;
completion never selects a replacement automatically.

Selection grants no implementation or claim authority. Preserve the existing
map/spec gates, tracker membership, native dependencies and claim rules.
Implementation always checks its specification's associated map, even if its
independently selected planning map points elsewhere. Before adopting a parent
also selected by another task, establish that task's ownership and obtain the
required handoff; creating another scope does not bypass claims.

A resume or move among worktrees sharing the same Git common directory retains
the explicit binding; checkout names and paths play no part. An independent fork
gets a new scope and task owner, and establishes its own authorized selections.
It cannot reuse a copied parent binding. For a separate clone, no state follows
automatically: preserve the old binding and require explicit validated selection
or import in the destination with handoff evidence. Missing host lifecycle or
source evidence stops the dependent transfer; never claim automatic cross-clone
or cross-machine synchronization.

## Human-approved handoff

Use this branch when the operator asks tasks to hand off or take over a map,
backlog or both. Reuse an existing explicit approval only for the named source,
recipient, selections, included claims and execution scope. A finished turn,
shared assignee, tool access or approval of this feature is not approval for an
unrelated real transfer.

1. Read the source and recipient task state with supported host tools, their
   retained selection bindings, related issues, claims, dependencies and unfinished
   repository work. Present the concrete transfer when approval is missing.
   Preserve a recipient's conflicting selection until the operator resolves it.
2. Stop source work in the transferred selections using available supported task
   controls or an acknowledged handoff. Verify quiescence, including delegated
   work and in-flight repository/tracker writes. Merely sending a message or seeing
   an old status is insufficient. Missing evidence preserves ownership.
3. Record approval, source-stop evidence, included claim transfers, unfinished
   changes/branch references, and the next permitted action in the existing task
   or tracker context. Keep private host/session details out of public tracker
   records. Use existing tracker owners to transfer included claims explicitly;
   do not reparent issues or change dependencies. Verify their readback. Leave
   source and recipient stopped if a partial failure needs investigation.
4. Invoke `transfer` on either selector with `--scope`, `--from-owner`,
   `--to-owner`, `--kinds map|backlog|both`, each selected kind's expected
   `--map-generation` / `--backlog-generation`, `--approval-ref`, and
   `--source-stopped-ref`. The references point to the actual evidence above.
   The helper requires them but cannot establish human approval or host
   quiescence: the supervising agent owns that verification.
5. The helper atomically changes only the named entries' owners and generations
   in the same scope. Verify the recipient's `show` result, establish its new
   binding, and recheck tracker claims and associated design before resuming.
   A partial transfer leaves the other entry and owner intact. Retire the source's
   transferred binding in its task context; its old owner/generation must now fail.
   Future work in the source task uses only its remaining authorized selections.

There is no distributed transaction with GitHub or task controls. On an uncertain
result, inspect actual selection and claim state, preserve partial effects, and
resume only the missing operation under the same approval. Do not restart source
work, silently reverse claims or repeat a completed transfer. Checking a binding
cannot cancel an already-running command; verified source quiescence is essential.

## Legacy import and rename

The old `codex-wayfinder-map` and `codex-implementation-backlog` files in Git's
common directory are historical inputs, never fallback selections. With explicit
migration authority, run the relevant selector's `import-legacy --scope <scope>
--owner <task> --expect-absent`. It validates that one legacy URL belongs to the
current repository and has the required issue role; closed historical issues are
allowed. It creates only the absent scoped entry and leaves both legacy files and
the other scoped entry unchanged. Import each kind separately and verify each
result. Existing destination state, malformed input or a failed lookup preserves
all state; investigate rather than choosing a different scope silently.

For an authorized repository rename, capture the map's immutable issue node ID
before the rename. After updating the remote, use map `refresh` with its scope,
owner, current generation and `--expected-issue-node-id`. It must resolve the same
issue in the current repository, including a completed map, then return the new
binding and canonical URL. A failed identity check preserves the selection.
