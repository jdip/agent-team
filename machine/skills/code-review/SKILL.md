name: code-review
description: "Review the changes since a fixed point (commit, branch, tag, or merge-base) along two axes: Standards (does the code follow this repo's documented coding standards?) and Spec (does the code match what the originating issue/spec asked for?). Checks both axes under the assigned reviewer’s ownership and reports them separately. Use when the user wants to review a branch, a PR, work-in-progress changes, or asks to \"review since X\"."
---

Two-axis review of the requested committed or working-tree changes:

- **Standards**: does the code conform to this repo's documented coding standards?
- **Spec**: does the code faithfully implement the originating issue / spec?

The primary agent selects the reviewer using [reviewer routing](reviewer-routing.md) after preparing the comparison and requirements below. This applies to explicit reviews and delivery reviews. An already assigned reviewer performs its axes directly and returns findings to the primary; it does not reroute or spawn reviewers. A single reviewer checks both axes unless assigned only one. Review is read-only: report fixes for the implementation owner.

Before publishing review comments or evidence, follow the target repository's
applicable publication policy.

Read the repository's instructions and available tracker guidance when fetching linked requirements. Missing tracker setup does not block review of requirements already supplied.

## Process

### 1. Pin the fixed point

Use the supplied base and target, including an explicit working-tree scope. Otherwise use the current PR's base or the documented delivery target and state it. Ask only when the intended comparison remains ambiguous after inspection.

Resolve commit refs to immutable SHAs and record the exact comparison. For a branch review, use `git diff <base-sha>...<head-sha>` and `git log <base-sha>..<head-sha> --oneline`. For work-in-progress review, include the requested staged and unstaged changes and inspect relevant untracked files; `...HEAD` alone omits them. Preserve unrelated work. If the requested scope is empty, report that rather than launching reviewers. A bad ref requires investigation.

### 2. Identify the spec source

Use the user's request and supplied assignment acceptance criteria, including later corrections, together with explicitly linked issues or documents. Fetch the originating issue/spec when identified by the assignment, PR, or commit messages; use relevant repository design sources for context. Preserve already supplied answers instead of asking for a separate spec file.

If a requirement is ambiguous or sources conflict, complete independent review and report the exact unresolved decision to the primary agent or user. When no requirements can be established, report the Spec axis as unavailable and still complete Standards review. Do not invent requirements from the implementation itself.

### 3. Identify the standards sources

Anything in the repo that documents how code should be written, such as `CODING_STANDARDS.md` or `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

On top of whatever the repo documents, the Standards axis always carries the **smell baseline** below: a fixed set of Fowler code smells (_Refactoring_, ch.3) that applies even when a repo documents nothing. Two rules bind it:

- **The repo overrides.** A documented repo standard always wins; where it endorses something the baseline would flag, suppress the smell.
- **Always a judgement call.** Each smell is a labelled heuristic ("possible Feature Envy"), never a hard violation. Like any standard here, skip anything tooling already enforces.

Each smell reads *what it is* → *how to fix*; match it against the diff:

- **Mysterious Name**: a function, variable, or type whose name doesn't reveal what it does or holds. → rename it; if no honest name comes, the design's murky.
- **Duplicated Code**: the same rule appears in more than one hunk or file in the change. → consolidate it with its owner when the semantics and reasons to change agree; similar syntax alone does not justify coupling callers.
- **Feature Envy**: a method that reaches into another object's data more than its own. → move the method onto the data it envies.
- **Data Clumps**: the same few fields or params keep travelling together (a type wanting to be born). → bundle them into one type, pass that.
- **Primitive Obsession**: a primitive or string standing in for a domain concept that deserves its own type. → give the concept its own small type.
- **Repeated Switches**: the same `switch`/`if`-cascade on the same type recurs across the change. → replace with polymorphism, or one map both sites share.
- **Shotgun Surgery**: one logical change forces scattered edits across many files in the diff. → gather what changes together into one module.
- **Divergent Change**: one file or module is edited for several unrelated reasons. → split so each module changes for one reason.
- **Speculative Generality**: abstraction, parameters, or hooks added for needs the spec doesn't have. → delete it; inline back until a real need shows.
- **Message Chains**: long `a.b().c().d()` navigation the caller shouldn't depend on. → hide the walk behind one method on the first object.
- **Middle Man**: a class or function that mostly just delegates onward. → consider removing it when callers need no additional knowledge afterward; retain useful naming, policy, or isolation.
- **Refused Bequest**: a subclass or implementer that ignores or overrides most of what it inherits. → drop the inheritance, use composition.

### 4. Review the assigned axes

Assess the target's applicable publication policy within both axes. Check outgoing
source, metadata and evidence and establish whether this review precedes the
change's first applicable GitHub write. Report any earlier unreviewed publication
as an exposure requiring investigation; a later review is not prevention.

For **Standards**, report violations of documented rules with the source rule and exact changed location. Apply the smell baseline as a heuristic, distinguishing actionable problems from optional improvements. Trace relevant callers and downstream effects. Apply the repository's Application Code/Tooling classification; assess actual required checks and evidence rather than inventing additional test suites or coverage requirements.

For **Spec**, identify missing or partial requirements, unrequested behavior, and incorrect implementations. Cite the supplied requirement and the changed location. Assess correctness, regressions, and relevant security implications within the requested scope.

For structural cleanup, dependency changes, or claims of simplification, also apply
[maintenance review](maintenance-review.md) within these same axes. Follow that
pointer when the change moves responsibilities, removes a path, or adds/replaces a
dependency, even if the PR does not call itself a refactor.

When the primary splits the axes, give each reviewer the same immutable comparison, applicable standards, requirements, and evidence. Assigned reviewers work directly without recursive delegation. The primary reconciles duplicate findings and remains accountable for coverage of both axes.

### 5. Report

Report Standards and Spec outcomes separately, with severity, exact file/line evidence, the concrete failure, and a focused correction for each actionable finding. State when an axis has no actionable findings or cannot be assessed. Distinguish review evidence from checks actually executed. Subsequent changes require review only of the changes and affected conclusions; completed evidence remains reusable where it still applies.

## Why two axes

A change can pass one axis and fail the other:

- Code that follows every standard but implements the wrong thing → **Standards pass, Spec fail.**
- Code that does exactly what the issue asked but breaks the project's conventions → **Spec pass, Standards fail.**

Reporting them separately stops one axis from masking the other.
